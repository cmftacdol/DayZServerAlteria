## Heading 2
We're passionate DayZ players who took our love for the game to the next level—by becoming admins. What started as long nights surviving the harsh world of DayZ turned into a mission to create the kind of hardcore DayZ experience we always wanted. Built by players, for players, our community is dedicated to realism, challenge, and that unmistakable adrenaline rush only DayZ can deliver. Whether you're a lone wolf or part of a squad, you're welcome here. Just remember—survival isn’t guaranteed.

📜 Server Rules – Read Before You Play
To keep the experience fair and enjoyable for everyone, all players must follow these rules:

🔫 PVE Only
This is a Player vs Environment server. No PvP, no killing other players under any circumstances.

🏚️ No Base Raiding
Raiding, breaking into, or looting other players' bases is not allowed.

⚠️ No Setting Up Traps
Traps intended to harm players—whether at bases, on roads, or elsewhere—are strictly prohibited.

🚫 No Stealing at Traders
Do not take items from players or their vehicles in Trader Zones. This includes looting unattended gear.

🚙 Open Vehicles = Fair Game
Unlocked vehicles found outside Trader Zones are considered free to loot or take.

🧠 Use Common Sense & Respect Others
Don’t be toxic, disrespectful, or exploit loopholes. Treat other players and staff with respect.

🗑️ No Littering
Clean up after yourself. Don’t leave junk, empty containers, or trash piles around the map.

♻️ No Loot Cycling
Do not drop and pick up loot repeatedly to force spawns. This breaks server balance and is not allowed.

🏚️ No Base Building in Military areas
We delete bases that are in a military loot zone.
